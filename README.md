# Autobiographical_Website
## The Purpose of the Website:

	The purpose of my autobiographical website is to provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of my professional and personal background. Through my resume section, visitors can learn about my work experience, education, and skills. In the hobbies section, I share my interests and passions, which helps visitors understand my personality and values. In addition, the website features my favourite movies and books, which can provide insights into my taste and preferences. Overall, my website aims to give visitors a holistic view of who I am and what I have to offer.

## Installation and Set-up Process:

	The set-up process for my autobiographical website is straightforward and requires no additional libraries. All necessary files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jpg, and pdf, are included in the "templates" folder.
	To get started, download the zip file and after click templates folder and right click to 'intro.html' and open with google chrome. As another way, simply open the "Theme 3" folder in VisualStudio. Crucially, the website should be launched with the "intro.html" file- can be adjusted through top left part after clicking the 'run and debug' section- change 'launch chrome' to 'open intro.html.' In the 'launch.json,' file path should be correct, which must end with "/Theme 03 /templates/intro.html', such as "/Users/berkiskar/Desktop/CS/Theme 03 /templates/intro.html." This will launch the website in your default web browser.
	All of the necessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jpg, and pdf files are located in the "templates" folder, so you don't have to worry about missing any dependencies. Plus, any extra libraries are implemented by links that I have provided within the files.
